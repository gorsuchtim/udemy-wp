Why do we use webpack?
It's a bundler -> we want to combine (bundle) multiple files into a single output file for JS and/or CSS
So we can better organize our javascript into components that import their dependencies

All dependencies, internal and external, are bundled into a single file

SETTING UP SIMPLE APPLICATION BUILD
Create at the root of the application and then open index.html and setup empty shell via "!" (touch index.html && code index.html)
Create src folder
Create 2 js files in src: index.js and hello-world.js (touch index.js && touch hello-world.js)
Reference the two js files in index.html (script:src to quickly build out the <script> tag w/ src attribute)
Reference index.js before hello-world.js
Setup hello-world js to run a function to console log (clg) "hello world"
Call this function in index.js

Because you have referenced index.js first it has no knowledge of hello-world.js - if you re-order them it works
If we had 100 JS files/modules or libraries this would become super hard to maintain

Webpack can manage those dependencies for us and bundle them into a single application code file to reference in our html

INSTALL WEBPACK AND INTEGRATE VIA NPM   
Create a package.json to manage our dependencies at terminal with `npm init -y`.  This creates an empty package.json
Install 2 webpack packages `npm i webpack webpack-cli.  Use the `--save-dev` flag to install as development dependencies
