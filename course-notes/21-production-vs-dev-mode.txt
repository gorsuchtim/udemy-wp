In production we want our website to be as fast as possible and our bundles to be as small as possible
During dev we want to see add'l info in our JS code like source maps and stuff we don't want in production

Mode
Remember in webpack config module.exports {} we have Mode
Mode has options for development and production builds available since webpack 4.  Previous versions need more work done here

We initially set to none so we wanted no built in optimizations
There are 3 possible values for mode.  "none", "development", "production"

Production mode allows a long list of plugins (like terser)
Production also sets `process.env.NODE_ENV on the DefinePlugin value to production.  We can use that variable in our JS code
to check if we are in production or development mode.

` if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") // do stuff you want to do in production `
` if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") // do stuff you want to do in development `

In development mode it will be much easier to debug since we aren't using the minified version of the code
Development mode uses sourcemaps by default
