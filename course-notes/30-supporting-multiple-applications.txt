Split out hello world and kiwi into different folders at the root of our project folder
We want to emulate having separately running applications - possibly with totally different dependencies & scripts/requirements
in package.json and possibly with different configurations.
We could, for example, have a multipage application running in one project and a SPA running in another

In server.js in both applications we only need 1 route for now so we can modify that and
we need to update the file name passed to the route

Because there are two applications running we have them running on different development ports in server.json
In webpack.dev.config the hello world app will run on port 9001 and kiwi will run on port 9002
We need to update the devServer port option AND update the devServer index option as well to take the value of the applications html file
(for example in kiwi we want kiwi.html)

Note that in the development and production configs we can now modify the rules -
because, for example, we don't need to handle images with hello world we can remove the image asset rule from hello world
We also are no longer testing for or using css so we can remove the css rules from both configs for both applications
