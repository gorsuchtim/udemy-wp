public path is a special config option that tells webpack which URL to use in order to load all the generated files in the browser.

If you're using static files like images in your app you can tell the browser where those files should be taken from 
using the public path config option

Prior to webpack 5, in config, in the `output` object publicPath was a required property.  Default was an empty string so any image
wouldn't be loaded automatically

By default webpack 5 sets publicPath to auto. And auto is an absolute path.
It can be set to a relative path in output using `publicPath: "dist/"` and then the src attribute url will be relative

output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "./dist"),
    publicPath: "dist/"
},
Make sure to include the trailing "/" when using publicPath
This is handy if you're using other resources like a CDN to serve your files or a module configuration feature and need a relative public path
