Create a new heading component: make a heading folder in components and create a heading.js component
class Heading {
  render() {
    const body = document.querySelector("body");
    const h1 = document.createElement("h1");
    h1.text = "I'm a silly heading";

    body.appendChild(h1);
  }
}

export default Heading;

Create a heading.scss file in the folder  - import this file to the heading.js file
Now import Heading into index.js and instantiate it

Re-run webpack and look at the styles.css file in the dist folder.  The styles for the new component are included in that file
