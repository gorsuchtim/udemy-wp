With plugins you minify results in the bundle, or define global constants, or output other files besides just bundle.js

All plugins available at webpack.js.org/plugins/

In the webpack.config file add a new array for plugins after the module {}


Minify
Terser is a plugin that will minify the code for you.  When we use any plugin we have to install it and create a const at the top of the config file
`npm i terser-webpack-plugin --save-dev`
`const TerserPlugin = require("terser-webpack-plugin");`

Remember --save-dev defines it as a development dependency - --save defines as production dependency
