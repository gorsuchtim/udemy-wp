Remember asset resource type generates a new file for the type of resource defined in test in the config rules
Asset inline injects the asset into the JS bundle as a base64 string (great for small resources like svg icons)

This is a combination of the two.  
If you leave type as `type: "asset"` then webpack will decide based on +/- 8kb on each file

To change that value you do so with "parser" as an extra option in that rule in the config.  In this ex if <3kb use "inline" if >3kb use "resource" type
`
rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpg)$/,
        type: "asset/resource",
        parser: {
            dataUrlCondition: {
                maxSize: 3 * 1024 // 3 kilobytes
            }
        }
      },
    ],
`
