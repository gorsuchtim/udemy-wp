Asset modules allow you to use asset modules in your application without installing additional dependencies
This is so you have ways of handling asset files like images, fonts, or plain text files to be processed by webpack

There are 4 types of asset modules you can use
Asset/resource: used for importing large images or large font files.  These asset module types generate new files in the output folder

Asset/inline inlines a file into a bundle as a data URI - used when importing small asset files like svgs that are usually injected to js bundle 
as dataURI.  This type doesn't generate a new file in the output folder

General asset is a combination of the two above types - if you just use asset then webpack will auto choose between /resource and /inline as your type
Based on asset size.  If it is <8kb it will be treated as inline module.  >8kb is resource module
This number is configurable

Asset source - maybe just need to import plain txt data this type can be used.  It imports source code of file as it is and injects it into the js
bundle as a string of text

You just need to make changes to your webpack config file to teach it to use
