Let's import and install React to get that built into the project

`npm i react --save-dev`

if you run the build and look at the terminal output you'll see there's no additional js being bundled/created.  Just the
hello-world and kiwi.js files.  When it was tested with lodash there was a dependency file created - but there isn't one for react

Webpack by default extracts common dependencies only when they exceed 30kb before minification.
Lodash is more than 30kb but react is much less

We can change that number and still extract <30kb libs from our output files (which is probably good) by specifiying that number to, say, 30kb
We add this in production config as an option in the optimization property.  See the notes in 26 re: optimization, splitChunks and chunks
This part of the config would now look like:

`
 optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: "all",
      minSize: 3000 // 3kb
    }
},
  `

Now we can have an extracted file for react
