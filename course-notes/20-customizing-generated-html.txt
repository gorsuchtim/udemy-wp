In webpack config we can pass add'l options to our HtmlWebpackPlugin to pass custom things like <title> and name of generated file
We can also output the custom file name file to a custom subfolder to keep the dist folder organized better 

Some custom configurations might look like this:
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    title: "Hello World",
    filename: "subfolder/custom_filename.html",
    meta: {
    description: "Some kind of info for description",
    },
}),

All of the options you can customize are on the github page for the plugin at 
https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin

All plugins available at webpack.js.org/plugins/
