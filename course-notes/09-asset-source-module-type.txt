Setting type in the test/type rules to source injects the contents of that file into a string and injects it into the bundle
as a string without any modifications so it won't coerce it to base64

That's all. Almost

Imagine you're wanting to do this with .txt files.  You can set up a new rule obj, right, in the rules array in config like:
{
    test: /\.txt/,
    type: "asset/source"
}
