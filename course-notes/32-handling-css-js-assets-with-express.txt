We need to send contents of file back to browser when we get an http request for this file.
We need to create a separate route to handle requests for all types of static files so we need to create a new route for that.

Our files are output into the dist folder
When we get a request we'll get that file and send it back using the express.static method to serve those files
We'll use `app.use("/static", express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, "../dist")));`

Now all requests that start with /static will go directly to our dist folder.
To hook this up right we'll want to make sure to include /static inside all of our static files inside index.html

We don't have to do this manually - we can just change the publicPath option in our webpack production configuartion
