Go back to html and remove the hello-world js file because we won't need that dependency - webpack will bundle it for us
Leave index.js as our main js file

Let the files communicate:
Set up the hello world function to be exported using `export default helloWorld;` at the end of that file/module
Go to index.js and import the hello world function `import helloWorld from "./hello-world.js";`
Go to terminal and run `npx webpack`

Here we've run webpack w/out any configuration at all and we can see index.js was built at ~58bytes and hello-world.js is 89bytes 
and webpack compiled in 93ms

Notice in your file structure that webpack has created a default output folder for us called dist and in it is an optimized main.js file

Now run webpack again with an option to show more details using `npx webpack --stats detailed`
This prints details near the top about the ENTRYPOINT.  This is the file webpack chooses as the starting point when building your application
This file usually imports other files from the application - webpack's default assumption is that the file is located in the `./src` folder
Since the name of the file isn't specified it will use index.js as the entrypoint as the default.  

This can be changed easily in the webpack configuration files
