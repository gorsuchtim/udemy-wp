Integrating webpack with node and express
Creating a backend for our application
Node, php, ruby, java.... anything could work but we will use node.js and express
And cover single page and multi page applications

To do this - the repo will split here into a branch for node-express-spa (single-page-application)
and a branch for node-express-mpa (multi-page-application)

Setup code for both can be found at https://github.com/vp-online-courses/webpack-tutorial

The code for the the SPA will be on the `integrating-express-js-into-a-single-page-application` branch
Code for MPA is on the `integrating-express-js-into-a-multiple-page-application` branch
