In server.js we need to read the contents of the html file into a js variable and send that string to the browser

we need to get an absolute path to our index.html using path.
So we can import path at the top of the file using `const path = require("path") and then
use path.resolve like we did in webpack config
We will specify __dirname as first arg and 2nd argument is the relative path to the html file in the dist folder

So inside of app.get() we will set up `const pathToHtmlFile = path.resolve(__dirname, "../dist/index.html");`

This sets up the path to the file and then we need to get the content
Now we need to read the contents of that file into a variable using fs.

We need to import fs at the top of the file with `const fs = require("fs");`
fs.readFileSync reads the file synchronously and returns a string.  
Pass it the path and specify the encoding as utf-8 so contents of file are stored as unicode
`const contentFromHtml = fs.readFileSync(pathToHtmlFile, "utf-8");

Now we must send the content stored in contentFromHtml to the browser
We use res.send(contentFromHtml);

If we load this we get an empty page in the browser - we haven't yet told express how to load our assets - 
We only said anytime there's an http request for the home URL send the index html page to the browser.

That's right but there are links to the js and css bundles but express doesn't know what to do with that yet.
