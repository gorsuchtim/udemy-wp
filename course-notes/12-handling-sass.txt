Change the hello-world-button file extension from .css to .scss
Creating generic sass variables for fun  and use them in the scss code
Update the import in hello-world-button.js to import .scss not .css

Install the npm package dependencies for sass-loader and node-sass
`npm i sass-loader node-sass --save-dev`
Node-sass is a library that provides bindings to lib sass.  Lib sass is the C version of the sass preprocessor.
Allows you to process sass to css at incredible speed

Create a rule obj for handling scss files.  You can copy the rule for css and just add "sass-loader" to that "use" array
{
    test: /\.scss$/,
    use: ["style-loader", "css-loader", "sass-loader"],
},

The order is important!  Read right to left this will convert our sass to css then take the css and convert it to the js representation
Then style loader will create style tags in our html page and put css into them
