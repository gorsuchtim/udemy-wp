Using mode in just a single config file, we would have to change mode back and forth from production to development depending on what we're doing

We should create 2 config files: one for production builds and one for development builds

So create a `webpack.production.config.js` and `webpack.development.config.js` and to start paste current webpack.config.js
content into both files

Production
Set mode to "production"
Terser can be removed because in mode: "production" Terser is included by default
Everything else is suitable for production

Development
Make sure mode: "development"
Can remove contenthash in development because we don't need browser caching
Can also remove Terser plugin because we don't need to minify during dev: it's an extra step & takes time
We want to optimize the build process to improve the development experience for the developer
We also don't need to extract our css to a separate file during development: that's mostly useful for production
So we can remove MiniCssExtractPlugin from the plugins array and plug style-loader back into the .css and .scss rules

Since we now have 2 config files instead of one we should make it possible to run them separately.
We can do this with scripts in the package.json

We will set up build as 
"build": "webpack --config webpack.production.config.js",
"dev": "webpack --config webpack.dev.config.js"
