Setting up the dev.config.js for multiple html page application.
We need to set up multiple entry points like we did in production.config
We also need to update the output filename to make it dynamic.  
Remember we did this in the production config by setting output filename to [name].js (we don't use contenthash in dev)
We need to add the 2nd html plugin to the list of plugins like we did in production

There will be nothing at the https://localhost:9000 URL because there's no root file.  We only have the html template files
So if we go to /hello-world.html or /kiwi.html we will see our page/template

We go to /our-page AND NOT TO /HTML-TEMPLATES/OUR-PAGE because we are going to a file in the output dist folder not in our 
local build folder
