We will create a simple webserver using node and express that will show content in the browser when the user loads our app

Install express in the terminal with `npm i express --save`   
Create file in src called server.js.  Backend code will go here.
Import express into this file with `const express = require('express');
This contains core functionality of express framework

Now create an instance of an express application that we will use later to define routes and to start a web server
`const app = express();`

Define a route that will send some content to the browser using .get() and send it two args
The first argument defines the URL that we'll react to and the 2nd arg is a function 
that function is invoked when the user goes to this URL
`
app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  // we are going to send some dynamic content back to the browser
  res.send("Just a big of placeholder text here");
});
`
Now we need to start a webserver and tell it to listen on a specific port so that the application
can start listening and reacting to incoming connections

A common pattern for node js applications is to use 3000 for the port
The 2nd arg is a function invoked right after the app starts
`
app.listen(3000, function() {
    console.log("Application is running on https://localhost:3000/");
});
`

Now we can add a script to the package.json file to conveniently run our server as `"start": "node src/server.js"`
This starts our server up on localhost 3000
